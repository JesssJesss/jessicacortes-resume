        My name is Jessica Cortes. I am currently a first year student attending University of California Riverside. I was raised in the city of Ontario in California but I was born and have now been living in the city of Montclair in California for 8 years. Throughout the years I have gained a tremendous amount of experience in different fields of work. I took some time off from school due to personal reasons for which I am thankful for because they made me the strong, dedicated, and ambitious person that I am today. I am a fulltime student and a part time employee performing a full time employment abundance of duties. 
	
At the moment I am working as a Human Resources Representative at Trend Technologies in the city of Chino in California. I have been working there for two years. I have found a passion for working with people and helping them have a successful and pleasant experience with our Human Resources department. I am in charge of time and attendance for approximately 180 employees at our plant alone. In addition to that I am responsible for making sure everything is ready to go so I can process payroll. Also, I have had the opportunity and privilege to learn about workers compensation and Hazardous waste management. Working at Trend Technologies has given me the chance to see that I am really interested in working in Human Resources. 	

Prior to Working at Trend Technologies, I worked at SLM Warehousing in the city or Rancho Cucamonga in California. I worked here for two years. Here I was the Shipping Supervisor and Payroll Assistant. I would oversee all the shipping going out including Loose transportation and Fedex shipments. There I shipped over five 52 footer containers a day and over 1500 individual Fedex packages. I would assure all this was done properly by coordinating the transportation services and supervising approximately 25 employees to get the job done efficiently and in a quick manner to meet strict deadlines and logistics regulations. I would also assure their time and attendance was in order to process payroll. I returned to University to further my education and was unable to continue working here due to the lack of time to fulfill my duties. I spent the last month of my employment there training two new supervisors. I am currently still on great terms with the owners and they are reachable as a reference. 

My experience in supervising and meeting strict deadlines has prepared me to continue my education and pursue a good career in Human Resources Management. I am driven and eager to learn more and grow more and more everyday. I am hardworking and intend on attaining internships to gain more knowledge in my field of study. 
I am excited to see what the future holds. I would like to find a workplace where I am given the opportunity to test myself and flourish with experience to continue growing in management expertise. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit more about myself.
